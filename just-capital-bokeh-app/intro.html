<h1>JUST Capital Rankings Explorer</h1>

<p>
    The <a href="https://justcapital.com/">JUST Capital Foundation</a> is an independent nonprofit that uses big data and market research to rank large corporations on the basis of how the American people define just corporate behavior. Yet, it is unrealistic to expect every American to agree on how exactly to define just corporate behavior. To address this, this application allows you to see how companies stack up in terms of <i>your own beliefs</i> about what is most important in evaluating a company's conduct. To specify what is most important to <i>you</i>, use the sliders below to rate how important each dimension of corporate conduct is to your sense of justice. The scale is 1 (not at all important) to 100 (extremely important). (Learn more about the included dimensions <a href="https://justcapital.com/drivers/">here</a>.)
</p>
<p>
    Each slider's starting value reflects the actual importance weight used to calculate JUST Capital's own rankings. As you adjust each slider, your custom ranking will be automatically calculated, displayed in the table on the upper right, and plotted against JUST Capital's ranking so you can see how your own rankings compare to those used by JUST Capital.
